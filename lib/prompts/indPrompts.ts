Examples from similar positions:
- "2kr1b1r" = rank 8: empty, empty, black king on c8, black rook on d8, empty, black bishop, empty, black rook on h8
- "pppqpppp" = rank 7: all black pawns except queen on d7  
- When you see "kr" together, this often indicates castling has occurred (king and rook repositioned)
- "KQ" in castling rights means White can castle both sides, "kq" means Black can castle both sides, "-" means no castling available

Step-by-step FEN parsing:
1. Split the FEN into ranks (separated by /)
2. For each rank, numbers represent empty squares, letters represent pieces
3. Uppercase = White pieces, lowercase = Black pieces
4. Place pieces accurately on the 8x8 grid

CRITICAL: Pay special attention to castled positions where kings and rooks are not on their starting squares.

- Draw an 8x8 grid based on the FEN. 
- Place each piece accurately. (Uppercase = White, lowercase = Black.) 
- Confirm files (a-h) and ranks (1-8) are correct.
- Double-check piece placement for accuracy, especially in complex positions

Structure your answer and follow the format of the examples exactly below for Critical Moment 1. IMPORTANT: 

- DO NOT add any other text to your response 
- Remember to format any chess notation with markdown backticks
- The move number of the {move_info} played and the {best_move} should always match exactly 
- Replicate the {move_info} played exactly in your response
- The engine line is in UCI format (e.g., e2e4 for pawn to e4) and is the continuation after the {best_move} use it to inform your analysis and do not replicate the whole line in the output
- The {opponents_best_move} is the best move to play from the opponent's perspective and should always be in the response
- The FEN string should never be shown in the <critical_moment> section output
- Use the Previous Position Context to understand recent captures, threats, and tactical developments that led to this position

<critical_moment>
## Critical Moment 1: Loss of Opening Advantage Due to Missed Central Break
### **Move 10. Bb5**

**Explanation:** White plays \`Bb5\`, pinning the knight on \`c6\` and appearing to increase pressure on Black's queenside. However, this move misses the critical opportunity to play \`c4\`, which would challenge Black's strong central presence and restrict Black's options. After \`Bb5\`, Black can respond with \`Bd7\`, easily breaking the pin and preparing to exchange off White's active bishop. The evaluation drops sharply from +0.37 to -0.51, indicating that White has not only lost their opening advantage but is now worse.

**Recommendation:** \`c4\`

**Why it's better:** The move \`c4\` directly contests Black's central control and opens lines for White's pieces. By playing \`c4\`, White puts immediate pressure on Black's \`d5\` pawn and gains space in the center. This move keeps the initiative and maintains equality or a slight advantage, preventing Black from consolidating with moves like \`Bd7\`. The missed opportunity allows Black to neutralize White's activity and seize the initiative.

Below is the engine analysis table for the chess game. Each row represents a move, including its evaluation and other relevant information:

Please follow these steps to complete the analysis:
    
Important criteria for selecting moments:
Look for:
- Major evaluation swings of at least +1 or -1
- Key tactical opportunities (missed or found)
- Critical strategic decisions
- Turning points in the game
- Consider both objective evaluation changes and human understanding

You must respond with a valid JSON object containing exactly 4 moments in chronological order.
Each moment must include these exact fields: 
- move_info: The move that was played at this critical moment
- move_number: The number of the critical move
- best_move: The best move to play at this critical moment
- evaluation: The evaluation after the critical move
- opponents_best_move: The best move to play from the opponent's perspective
- fen: The FEN string after the critical move
- continuation: The engine's suggested continuation
- full_line: The complete table row for this move
